1) Use fdisk.h to format with custom DFS blocksize

2) 3)
  dfs_shared.h has DFS_MIN_BLOCKSIZE which helps in determining DFS_FBV_MAX_NUM_WORDS
  dfs_shared.h has DFS_INODES_MAX_NUM which sets it to 200 - its not really used by user program but we just kept it in shared since its more consistent keep that with FBV_MAX_NUM_W for better readability

4) For ostests
   First run `make run` with fdisk to format the disk
   Then run `make run` once to create hello file inode and its related
   Then run `make run` again to
    - show that filesystem is persistent
    - working functionality of inode functions
    - checks with 1250 address for unaligned access
    - the test for indirect block addressing test uses 5160 as a test address
      - as 512 is the DFS block size that was used to format the disk

5) 6) make and make run

7) Incomplete will be giving errors
